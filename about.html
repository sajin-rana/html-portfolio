<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi, Hello and Namaste!</h2>

  <h3>I am Sajin Rana.</h3>
  <h3>About me.</h3>
  
  
 <p> I was born in the Himalayan country of Nepal in 2000. 
  Grew up with a loving grandparent and with the people who love me and so do i. As my parents separated at an earlier age (can’t remember why exactly) and they lived abroad also, 
  I never got a chance to spend my childhood with them. But no regret as I have my grandparent who used to take good care of mine. 
  As I complete my school in the same home town that I grew up in, I move to the city area to join college which is not too far so that I am still living with my grandparent.</p>
  
  <h2>How?</h2>
  <h3>So, how did I get into this Web Development?</h3>
  <p>Things changed in 2018 when I decided to drop out of college and went to Hongkong to work to support my family as well as to be independent. 
  As my dad is already there living in Hong Kong it's easier for me to get started in a new country. 
  As you know, without a college degree and without any work experience or skill I couldn’t find a proper job. 
  So I started to work as a waiter, security guard, kitchen helper, general labor, foodpanda delivery rider and so on. 
  After sometime I relaize that if I want to move ahead in life I have to learn some skill. And that's how I get started.</p>
  
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <h3>Why did I change my mind from affilate business to web development?</h3>
  
 <p> As I start to work from an earlier age, getting that first salary is always exciting for me. 
  At first, I enjoyed it, like living an independent life, earning some of my first income, and spending on the thing that I want is really great.
  But after a while, I felt different, felt like a loser, and felt like people around me also saw me as a loser. Now at that time, I realize that money isn’t the thing that I want. 
  I want to do something more valuable rather than just working for others. And of course, slowly I started to hate my job. Working long hours a day, six-day a week is really sucking me up.
  But the situation got worse when my grandparent's health went bad as they are getting old also and they are in Nepal. So I decided to move to Nepal to live with my grandparents again. 
  But this time I want to do something to make income from the home, as well as taking care of my grandparents also. So, I decided to build an online business. </p> 
 
  <h2>When?</h2>
  <p>After working one and half years and changing five or five jobs, I am totally crystal clear that this job isn’t for me. . 
  So, I started to research on the internet for a while to find out my other option. 
  And after three months of research and trying different business models and opportunities, on 22nd October 2019 I exactly found what I need. 
  Working from home with just access to the internet and laptop. 
  I got recommendations from the people who are running a successful online business from the internet, 
  to try the platform called mentors, where there is a community full of digital entrepreneurs, sharing their idea and helping each other to get success. 
  So, I jump in, sign up, and here I am now, writing about me on my website as well as making sure to share what I learned through my journey.</p>
  
  <h3>More about me...</h3>
  
  
  <p>Love to ride two wheels as well as going on a long tour for a week also. 
  Have a small circle of people, however, I love to spend time with family and friends. 
  And also with myself. I am kind of a lazy guy who has no time schedule, eats whenever I want, and sleeps whenever I want. 
  Mostly going to bed in the morning and waking in the afternoon. No exact time for eating and also no habit of healthy food that’s why I am overweight. 
  Planning to make six-packs for the past two years and still planning. Love to live alone and love to live a life in my own way. 
  Also, a moody guy who loves to do whatever and whenever I want. 
  </p>
  <p>Hope now you know me well and I hope I introduce myself well also. </p>
